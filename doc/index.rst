    Documentation of the *Quantum Quantitative Finance Library* (**QQuantLib**) associated with the use case of *Financial Applications* of the Work Package **Machine Learning & Optimisation** of the NEASQC European project.

    **QQuantLib** is a Python library developed using **myQLM** (**EVIDEN** quantum software stack) containing following packages:

* :doc:`dl`: This is the *Data Loading (DL)* package which contains modules related to the loading of the data.
* :doc:`aa`: This is the *Amplitude Amplification (AA)* package which contains modules related to amplitude amplification operators.
* :doc:`pe`: This is the *Phase Estimation*  package which contains modules for phase estimation algorithms that can be used in amplitude estimation procedures. 
* :doc:`ae`: This is the *Amplitude Estimation* package which is devoted to different amplitude amplification algorithms.
* :doc:`finance`: This package implements different modules related to finance applications of *Amplitude Estimation* techniques.
* :doc:`qml4var`: This package contains modules for training **PQCs** for using as surrogate models for Financial **CDFs** for VaR computations.
* :doc:`qpu`: This package contains a module for selecting the different **EVIDEN** *Quantum Process Units* (**QPUs**) for simulating the different circuits created by the different modules of the **QQuantLib** library.
* :doc:`utils`: This package contains auxiliary modules used for all the beforementioned packages.
