* :doc:`utils.utils_utils`: Several auxiliary functions used across other packages of QQuantLib are stored in this module.
* :doc:`utils.data_extracting`: This module implements several  functions that allow the execution of quantum routines (or programs) and formatting the obtained results properly (in general by returning pandas DataFrames)
