# The Notebooks

The notebooks present and explain the different functionalities of the **QQuantLib** and how they can be used to solve typical problems encountered in the financial industry. 

The **Financial Applications** use case of the NEASQC *WP5* focuses on developing quantum solutions, algorithms, and software libraries for two different Financial problems: *option pricing* and *VaR* computation.

## Option Pricing

For the option price problem, the **Quantum Accelerated Monte Carlo (QAMC)** algorithm was our starting point (see our project deliverable [D5.4: Evaluation of quantum algorithms for pricing and computation of VaR](https://www.neasqc.eu/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/NEASQC_D5.4-Evaluation_of_quantum_algorithms_for_pricing_and_computation_of_VaR_R1.0.pdf) and references therein). The quantum speed-up of the algorithm is located just at the end of **QAMC**, in the **quantum Amplitude Estimation (AE)** procedure. The **QQuantLib** allows the user to build the different mandatory blocks to simulate the last step of the **QAMC** using the **myQLM EVIDEN** software. In addition to other state-of-the-art **AE** techniques, the **QQuantLib** includes our new **Real Quantum Amplitude Estimation (RQAE)**, developed into the framework of the NEASQC project, that allows to estimate, not only the amplitude of a state but also the sign. Several functionalities, for solving the option pricing problem, using the different available **AE** algorithms were developed too.  

The following notebooks explain the part of the **QQuantLib** devoted to using **AE** algorithms to solve the option pricing problem:

## Quantum Machine Learning for VaR 

One of the main important tasks in financial institutions is risk assessment particularly the computation of the **Value at Risk (VaR)** which measures the potential loss in case of an unlikely event. This metric requires computing a quantile once a **Cumulative Distribution Function** is available. 

The **QQuantLib.qml4var** package aims to train **Parametric Quantum Circuits (PQC)**, using **myQML EVIDEN** software, that can be used as surrogate models for complex and time-consuming financial **CDF**s. The **QQuantLib.qml4var** package includes a new loss function definition, $R_{L^2, {\bar L}^2}^{S_{\chi}}$, developed into the framework of the NEASQC (see Manzano A. (2024). Contributions to the pricing of financial derivatives contracts in commodity markets and the use of quantum computing in finance, Doctoral dissertation, Universidade da Coru√±a). This loss function trains **PQC** models with better behaviours along all domain range, than traditional ones when the sizes of training datasets are low.
