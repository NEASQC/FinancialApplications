    "# Quantum Machine Learning for Risk Assessment\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main important tasks in financial institutions is risk assessment particularly the computation of the *Value at Risk* (**VaR**) which measures the potential loss in case of an unlikely event. \n",
    "\n",
    "This risk metric is simple to calculate once the shape of the financial distribution is determined, as it only requires a quantile calculation of the distribution. \n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the computation of these financial distributions is complex and highly time-consuming, making the calculation of **VaR** using them impractical in production environments. \n",
    "\n",
    "One approach involves building a surrogate model trained with samples from the complex and well-calibrated financial model. The surrogate model can be evaluated quickly and used more efficiently for VaR calculations. The main issue with this approach is that the surrogate model cannot accurately represent the tails of the financial distribution, which are essential for **VaR** computations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing Differential Machine Learning (**DML**) can help create a more reliable surrogate model that is suitable for **VaR** computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The **QQuantLib.qml4var** package from the *FinancialApplications* software library enables users to construct Parametric Quantum Circuits (**PQC**) and train them using techniques from **DML** to develop surrogate models for **VaR** computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The theoretical basis of this work can be found in:\n",

    "Let $F(\\textbf{x})$ a Cumulative Distribution Function, **CDF**, representing a complex and time-consuming financial distribution, where $\\textbf{x}=\\{x_0, x_1, \\cdots x_{m-1}\\}$ is the input feature vector. \n",

    "\n",
    "The primary objective is to construct a Parametric Quantum Circuit (**PQC**) $F^*(\\textbf{x}, \\theta)$, serving as the surrogate model. This model, trained on the $\\tilde{\\textbf{x}}^j$ samples, should provide an accurate approximation $F(\\textbf{x})$, enabling efficient computations **VaR**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The training procedure follows the standard approach used in Machine Learning (**ML**): define an appropriate **loss function** and then determine the set of parameters (i.e., weights) $\\theta$ that minimize this **loss function**.\n",
